user_restaurant_router Module


Author: Sebastian AvendaÃ±o Rodriguez
Date: 2024/11/26
Description: This module provides API endpoints for managing user restaurant in a restaurant management system.
            It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete their bookings. The endpoints are secured
            with JWT authentication to ensure that only authenticated users can access their restaurant information.
