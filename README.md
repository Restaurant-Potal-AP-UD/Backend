## Project Description
This project is a backend service designed to handle user management, restaurant creation, restaurant listings, booking systems, and payment processing (coming soon). It leverages various technologies to ensure robust and efficient operations.

## TECHNOLOGIES

### Java
- **Spring Boot**: Used to build the core user management system.
- **Pom Dependencies**: Located in the `pom.xml` file.

### Python
- **FastAPI**: Used to build the whole source code behind restaurant, reviews and booking information

### MySQL
- The main database used for persistent storage.

### H2
- Used for testing purposes.

### Docker
- Used for containerization to simplify installation on other machines.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed.

### Setup
1. **Create or log in to your Docker account**.
2. **Open Docker Hub**.
3. **Execute**:

## Testing

### Unit Testing
This project includes essential unit testing implemented in each language.
- [Python Testing](https://github.com/Restaurant-Potal-AP-UD/Backend/tree/main/test)<br>
  This directory contains Python unit tests managed by Docker Compose.
  - [Python Testing Code](https://github.com/Restaurant-Potal-AP-UD/Backend/tree/main/restaurant-reviews-bookings/restaurant-service/test)<br>
    This directory houses all the code for integration testing of every endpoint in the project.

- [Java Testing](https://github.com/Restaurant-Potal-AP-UD/Backend/tree/main/login-register/src/test)<br>
  This directory contains Java testing code. Every test it's managed by Junit in combination with Spring Boot
